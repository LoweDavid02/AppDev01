## Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub

I want to learn Git and GitHub because they are powerful tools that every developer should master. Git will help me manage and organize my code changes, making it easier to work systematically and avoid mistakes. GitHub, on the other hand, will let me share my work, collaborate with others, and build a portfolio of projects that I can show to future opportunities. By learning these tools, Iâ€™ll be better prepared for teamwork and professional software development.
