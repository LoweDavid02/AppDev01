# Autonomous Vehicles  
 
Autonomous vehicles (AVs), also known as self-driving cars, are vehicles equipped with advanced sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning systems that enable them to operate without human intervention (EV Magazine, n.d.). These vehicles rely on technologies such as LiDAR, radar, cameras, and GPS to perceive their surroundings and navigate safely (EV Magazine, n.d.).  

The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) classifies automation into six levels (0 to 5), with *Level 5* representing full autonomy—requiring no human input under any driving conditions (SAE International, 2021, as cited in EV Magazine, n.d.).  

## Purpose   
The primary objectives of autonomous vehicles include:  

1. *Safety* – Reducing human-caused accidents, such as those resulting from distraction or impairment (EV Magazine, n.d.).  
2. *Efficiency* – Optimizing traffic flow, minimizing congestion, and enhancing fuel economy through AI-driven navigation (EV Magazine, n.d.).  
3. *Accessibility* – Providing mobility solutions for individuals unable to drive, including older adults and people with disabilities (EV Magazine, n.d.).  
4. *Convenience* – Allowing passengers to utilize travel time for work or leisure (EV Magazine, n.d.).  
5. *Environmental Benefits* – Supporting electric and shared mobility models to reduce carbon emissions (EV Magazine, n.d.).  

## Usage 
- *Ride-Hailing & Taxis* (e.g., Waymo, Cruise) (EV Magazine, n.d.).  
- *Freight & Delivery* (e.g., autonomous trucks by TuSimple, Embark) (EV Magazine, n.d.).  
- *Public Transport* (e.g., self-driving shuttles) (EV Magazine, n.d.).  
- *Industrial & Agricultural Use* (e.g., autonomous mining and farming vehicles) (EV Magazine, n.d.).  

As the technology evolves, AVs are anticipated to transform transportation by improving safety, efficiency, and accessibility (EV Magazine, n.d.). 

### Example
### Tesla 
- Known for electric vehicles, Tesla integrates advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and aims to develop fully autonomous cars through its Full Self-Driving (FSD) package. Successes include leading the EV market and significant advancements in battery technology. Challenges encompass ensuring autonomous system safety and reliability, ~regulatory scrutiny, competition and public concerns about self-driving technology.
