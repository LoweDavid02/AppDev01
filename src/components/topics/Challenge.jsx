import React from 'react'

export default function Challenge() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h3>Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        Move Profile to its own file and import it into Gallery. Then render
        both <code>&lt;Profile /&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Gallery /&gt;</code> from
        the root App component — that's already implemented here.
      </p>
